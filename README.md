# Code Cupid
## Inspiration
Our inspiration for creating this project was the need for help on our own personal projects over the years. While applications exist to assist in that regard, none are as intimate or trustworth as some users would like. That is why we came up with Code Cupid.

## What it does
Code Cupid has users create an account. There, users input their skills and decide if they need help or want to help. If a person decides to ask for help, they post a description of their work and issue, and have a rudimentary desgin of their end goal. Once its out people who have the skills you need can come across your project and help. When a person decides to help you, they are shown your code and have access to whatever information you permit in your original post. With as many or as little people as you want, you can finish your project and have fun while doing so.
On the other hand, if you decide to help others, you will be redirected to the main page. On the main page, you will have access to an incredibly interactive GUI. This GUI inducts a swipe-based system, wherein users come across profiles and swipe if they would like to help them, or if they are not interested. If you are not interested in a project, you swipe that way and move on to the next. However, if you do decide to help with a project, and you swipe that way, the author will be notified. The author can then take your request into consideration before permitting you to help them.

## How we built it
We were able to build Code Cupid utilizng react JS, next JS, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Apolla, Hasrura, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud, Firebase, AWS, Graph-QL, and Vercel.

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into was integrating a fun, but not overzealous swipe feature. Another issue was accurately implementing notification features into the system depending on each swipe.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Overall, we are extremely proud of the product we have currently. Given only a day, we were able to establish a wesbite with features unlike any others. The team that worked on Code Cupid is proud of the website and everyhting we've learned from making it.

## What we learned
What we learned from making Code Cupid varied from member to member. Some were able to refine their skills with the develoopment of the website, and others learned an incredible amount of programming and its application in the real world.

## What's next for Code Cupid
What's next for Code Cupid is continuous development. You see, as we were constructing this project, we realized its real benefits in the real world. That's why each of us have agreed to fully commit to Code Cupid in order to manufacture a fully functioning  and useful product.
